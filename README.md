## Assignment

In this assignment you will start with a basic calculator and style it using `CSS`, `inline styles`, and `styled-components`. 

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; padding: 10px 0;">
<img src="images/worst_calculator.png" alt="calculator example" width="350"/>
</div> 

As you can tell the current layout needs a lot of styling work. Modify the layout, components, and calculator logic however you want. Everything is free game! 

## Deliverable

1. Style the calculator however you want. Feel free to use any colors, layout, and animations that you would like. Be as creative as you want.
2. Can you find any edge cases with the calculator logic? Make a note about what you find.
3. In a quick couple of sentences justify your design choices

## Bonus Points 

(NOTE: Make sure you feel comfortable with your A2 submission before attempting these)

1. The calculator currently doesn't support a decimal places. Modify the logic and UI so that it supports decimal places.
2. It also doesn't support negative numbers. Modify the logic and UI so that it supports negative numbers.
